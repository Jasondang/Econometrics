## Introduction

This exercise considers an example of data that do not satisfy all the standard assumptions of simple regression.
In the considered case, assumption A6 that the coefficients α and β are the same for all observations is violated.
The dataset contains survey outcomes of a travel agency that wishes to improve recommendation strategies for its
clients. The dataset contains 26 observations on age and average daily expenditures during holidays.

### Loading in the dataset

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
